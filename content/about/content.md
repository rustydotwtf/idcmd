# About

This is a sample about page to demonstrate file-based routing.

## Why this approach?

Instead of using a full framework like Next.js, this setup uses:

- **Bun** as the runtime and server
- **React** for SSR via `renderToString`
- **Vercel** for hosting with edge caching

> The result is a lightweight, fast, and simple architecture.
